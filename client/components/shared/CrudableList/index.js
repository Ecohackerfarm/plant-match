/**
 * The inCRUDable List! Just kidding. It is very much CRUDable.
 * It can be used to generate lists of items that can be Created, Read, Updated, and Destroyed
 * And it handles a lot of it for you! You still need to write a few things, and for them to work
 * with CrudableList, they have some specific requirements (parameters) that must be followed.
 * See {@link client.components.shared.CrudableList.CrudableListPage}
